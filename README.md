# ObnoxiousThing

Turns your messages into obnoxious things. Rehash of Metalloriff's The Clap Best Clap Plugin Clap Ever. Also the code structure is blatantly taken from Lighty, with permission. Check out their plugins!

To use, type `claps:` before a message and send it to replace all spaces with :clap:. Type `ra:` before a message and send it to replace all letters and numbers with regional indicators (huge emoji versions of letters). It's so awful.

Best part is, you can combine them! Please don't use this unless you want people to hate you.
